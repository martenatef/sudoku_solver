# sudoku_solver
This Python terminal-based Sudoku solver uses backtracking to fill a 9×9 grid. Empty cells (0) are filled following Sudoku rules—no repeats in rows, columns, or boxes. It prints the board before and after solving. Ideal for learning recursion, backtracking, and constraint-based algorithms.
